**Dark conformal phase transitions GW**

This repository contains the report and code developed during my 2025 summer research internship at LIP (Portugal) on gravitational waves from supercooled conformal phase transitions.

**Supervisor:** Prof. António P. Morais (University of Minho, LIP)

**Abstract:**
We investigate the dynamics of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in a classically scale-invariant dark sector featuring a single scalar field coupled to a hidden gauge symmetry. Radiative breaking of conformal invariance occurs through the Coleman–Weinberg mechanism, while renormalization-group (RG) improvement ensures a consistent treatment of quantum corrections. Finite-temperature effects, including daisy resummation, generate a thermal barrier that drives a strongly supercooled phase transition. We analyze the resulting effec tive potential at small field values, highlighting the emergence of shallow minima relevant for low-frequency gravitational waves detectable by pulsar timing arrays. From the effective potential we extract the critical, nucleation, and percolation temperatures, as well as key transition parameters (α, β/H). These are then used to compute
